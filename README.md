### I have done EDA using Pandas and for Visualization I have used Matplotlib and Seaborn.

To answer these questions I used many different pandas, matplotlib and seaborn library methods. They include:
- Used info() to get information about columns data and datatype
- Used isnull() to check null value
- Used describe() for descriptive stats
- Adding columns
- Using the sort_values() method to sort data
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting lines graphs and countplot to visualize our results
